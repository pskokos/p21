/*
 * For Binary Search Tree, I started off constructing the basic boolean methods, 
 * and from there constructed the tree beginning from the root. There were a
 * few hiccups when trying to implement the height and depth of the tree, despite
 * my tracing of the algorithm working. As for the inorder traversal, it starts from 
 * the center and works out, so that the tree is visible, it just doesn't look like a 
 * typical tree
 * 
 * AS for the hash table, the general function is there, but I didn't have enough time 
 * to check each and every method, however, all of them do compile, and run more or less
 * without many bugs. 
 * the tests are pretty clear and also include an interface with which to implement the data
 * structures
